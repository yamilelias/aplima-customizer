# APLIMA CUSTOMIZER

This is a simple plugin that will add lost functionality to the theme that was installed. It was a free theme so much of the
personalization was lost. This is to add some new functions and recover some others. Maybe it can help you with your free theme,
because it includes some of the most common blocked functions from free themes. This is not an attempt to have a pirate plugin, is
just another simple plugin that adds cool functions.
